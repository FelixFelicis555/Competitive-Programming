# Union Find Algorithm

Union-Find ( or Disjoint Set Data Structure ) is used to group together a number of elements in a set and check if two elements belong to same set or are from different sets. This algorithm is used to solve the dynamic connectivity problem in Computer Science & Graph Theory.

There are quite a few approaches designing a disjoint set data structure. 
1. With fast union, but slow find
2. With fast find, but slow union
3. With fast union and fast find ( by using path compression )
