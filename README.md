# ACM ICPC Handbook

This repository contains the implementation of almost all Algorithms, from basic to complex ones ( Under Progress )
It's supposed to be used as an ACM ICPC Handbook.

## About ICPC

ACM Inter Collegiate Programming Contest is often called the Olympics of Programming . Knowledge of Algorithms as well as how to implement them is important, besides using logic and Mathematics.

## For Contributors

Addition of new algorithms is highly encouraged.However, it should be noted that the implementation should be done according to ACM ICPC Rules , that is , the code must be in C / C++ / Java / Python ( Python has recently been inculded at ICPC World Finals, in effect from 2016 )
