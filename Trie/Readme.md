# Trie
There are many algorithms and data structures to index and search strings inside a string, some of them are included in the standard libraries, but not all of them.
Tries are one of those which aren't included in standard libraries.
Tries are extremely special and useful data structures that are based on the prefix of a string.Tries are used for "reTRIEval" of data.
Trie data structures enable to store strings that can be visualized like a graph.
