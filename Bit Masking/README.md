# Bit Masking

Bit Masking refers to the technique of representing a subset of a set using a " Bit Vector " , where i'th bit of the vector is set if and only if the corresponding element
belongs to the Subset.

## Example

Given a Set S = {a,b,c,d) , then if Bit Vector = {1,0,1,1} then
Subset is {a,c,d} .

## Usage

As clear from the definition, it is useful where ever subsets have to be considered, and is usually needed in competitive programming when all subsets have to be iterated upon.

## Problem Statement - Sample

Given a Set S of integers, find the number of subsets of S whose elements sum up to a given value K .
