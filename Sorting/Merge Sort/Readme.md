# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a fast sorting algorithm based on Divide and Conquer Approach .

## Algorithm

Merge Sort Algorithm divides the given sequence of numbers into two parts (and keeps on dividing until we have just one single element), sorts them and then merges them effectively to produce an entire sorted array.In order to understand this algorithm, watch this short and awesome video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQ8pwjQxTM 

## Time Complexity

Average Case : O(nlogn)
Best Case: O(nlogn)
Worst Case: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

Requires an Auxillary Space of order O(n)

## Comparision with Quick Sort Algorithm
