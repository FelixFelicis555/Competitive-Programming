# Bitset
Bitsets are important data structures which could be really handy in Competitive Programming.Bitset is basically an array of boolean values which
optimizes space by taking just one bit for each boolean value, hence it's better than a boolean array or a boolean vector ( vector <bool> ).
The only limitation it has in comparison to a boolean array/vector is that the SIZE must be known at COMPILE TIME.
